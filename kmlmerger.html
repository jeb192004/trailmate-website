          <span>This tool merges KML files into a single layer, removing layer styles. The files are not uploaded, but are processed within the browser. Currently, KMZ files are not supported.  Any unknown file types or malformed files are skipped.  Large files are likely to be problematic.  Tested using Chrome. Feel free to view the source and make your own modifications.  Email us if you run into issues or have a feature request: brassmonkery @ gmail.com.</span>
